		<year>Nov. 21, 1949</year>
		<excerpt>This is one of 8 Hanukkah songs Woody Guthrie wrote in late November of 1949.</excerpt>
		<museum-text>In a situation similar to that of “Hanukah Tree,” the bell is most likely a symbol which Guthrie pulled from the Christian imagery he was familiar with. The repetition of words at the end of lines is reminiscent of the playfulness of his children's songs.</museum-text>

		<year>1948</year>
		<excerpt>This song was written in the aftermath of World War II and the atrocities of the Holocaust.</excerpt>
		<museum-text>Ilse Koch (name misspelled by Guthrie), was the wife of commander of the Nazi concentration camps Buchenwald and Majdanek. Koch was one of the most prominent Nazis tried  by the U.S. Military in 1947. Therefore, Guthrie may have had these events on his mind at the time of the song’s writing.</museum-text>
